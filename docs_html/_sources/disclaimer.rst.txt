I am not responsible of the correct or incorrect working or your use of NCDRT.  I
have tested the tool  and I use it to reduce and  analyse my own data
(project P3B01): it seems to work fine.  I am not responsible for any
problems with your  data that may occur from  using NCDRT.  Always be
careful  with your  data, and  make a  backup copy  before  you start
reducing and analysing.

Please also  feel free to use the source files and adapt them to your personal needs, 
expanding the tool with other utilities.
