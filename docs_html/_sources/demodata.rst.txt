Demonstration data from project Mars P3B01
==========================================

The  directory :file:`/home/your_name/idlproc/NCDRT/demo` contains  a couple
of observations of  Mars and of the calibrator  source 3C123 taken at
the end of August 2003.  You  can test the funcionalities of NCDRT on
these   data.    Just   untar   the  ;file:`NCDRT_demo.tar`   file   to   the
:file:`/home/your_name/idlproc/NCDRT`  directory (or  any other  directory of
your  choice).  The  observations  :code:`050466` and :code:`060341` are  the  same
observations  as :code:`050403`  and  :code:`053737` respectively  but without  Mars.
These are included to demonstrate  the working of the 
:ref:`Sky Subtraction Tool <skysubtractiontool>`.  The pair (:code:`053737,060341`) include a time shift.
