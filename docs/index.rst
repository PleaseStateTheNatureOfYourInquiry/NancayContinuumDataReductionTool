Nançay Continuum Data Reduction Tool
====================================

I developed this Nançay Continuum Data Reduction Tool (NCDRT) in the summer of 2004 to perform the reduction and initial analysis of observations of planet
Mars with the Nançay  Radio Telescope (France), under project ID P3B01.
The observations were performed between July 2003 and June 2004. 

It is entirely written in Interactive Data Language (IDL) v5.4, but I believe it also works under (far) more recent versions, as IDL has been extremely 
backward compatible. 
In fact, I ran it several years ago successfully on a `GDL distribution <https://gnudatalanguage.github.io/>`_, but have not tried it (or used it) since.
At this time it would probably be a good idea to translate the whole project to Python, using PyQt as the tool to build the GUI.


These instruction pages (NCDRT V2.1 August 2004) are adapted from the content of 
the `ncdrt_v2.1_help.txt <https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/NancayContinuumDataReductionTool/blob/main/distribution/ncdrt_v2.1_help.txt>`_ 
file and transformed to ReStructured Text format to be able to compile to html with a ReadTheDocs theme.
The original file can be found in the distribution folder of the repository.

The  file and  parameter names have been chosen to be as obvious as possible and as many comments as possible have  been included in the programme 
sources.
