 1. Introduction.

 1.1 Why NCDRT.

 These are the detailed instructions  for using and adapting the NCDRT
 V2.1 (August  2004).  The  tool has been  developed to reduce  and to
 perform  some initial analysis  of continuum  data acquired  with the
 Nancay  Radio Telescope  (NRT). It  has been  developed in  the first
 place to deal with data from project P3B01, for which planet Mars was
 observed between  July 2003 and June  2004.  In this  version the Sky
 Subtraction  Tool has  been  added.  Result  files  for the  previous
 version (V2.0)  are compatible with the current  version.  Also, some
 small bugs have been solved and extra protections have been added.

 NCDRT  has not  been  developed by  a  professional programmer.   The
 programming  style is  quite  pragmatic and  certainly  not the  most
 optimum.  Yet,  is works  (it seems).  The  file and  parameter names
 have been chosen to be as obvious as possible and as much comments as
 possible have  been included in the programme  sources (but certainly
 not enough :-)).



 1.2 Installing and adapting NCDRT to your system.

 NCDRT uses  IDL 5.4  or higher.  Untar  the NCDRT_V2.1.tar file  to a
 directory      of      your      choice,     for      example      in
 /home/your_name/idlproc/NCDRT/.  Also include  the following  line in
 your .cshrc file:

   setenv IDL_PATH /home/your_name/idlproc/NCDRT:${IDL_PATH}

 This will make IDL search this directory for programme files.

 Some routines in NCDRT use  the /bin/rm and /bin/cp command to remove
 and copy temporary files. On some computer systems these commands are
 located in the /sbin or other directories.  Please check the location
 of these executables before you  run NCDRT. If necessary make changes
 in the following routines:

  delete_from_cal_table.pro 
  read_list.pro
  write_2_cal_table.pro

 look for the  'USER: RM and CP commands'  keyword in these files.

 The routine  read_list.pro  uses the command /bin/ls. Look for the 
 'USER: LS command' keyword in this file if a change is required.



 2. Working with NCDRT.

 2.1 Preparing for using NCDRT.

 Data from the NRT come in four files with the following structure:

   fil050673.213
   pou050673.213
   log050673.213
   sfr050673.213

 050673 is  the observation id, 213  is the observer id.  The data are
 stored  in the fil  file. The  pou file  contains information  on the
 observation setup. The log file contains a log of the observations.

 The  programme NAPS,  developed  by  the NRT-team,  must  be used  to
 preprocess the  data. NCDRT uses  fits files. NAPS can  transform the
 initial NRT data to fits format.

 In order to  use NCDRT correctly, the fits files must  be in the same
 directory as the  original data files. In order  to achieve this, set
 the directory to write the fits files in NAPS:

   NAPS> set result fits
   NAPS> set dirdata /home/your_name/ncdrt/data/
   NAPS> set dirfits /home/your_name/ncdrt/data/

 With the NAPS  save command NRT data read into NAPS  is saved to fits
 files with the following file  format, averaging over the cylces, one
 fits file for each of the eight channels:

    f050673_f1.fits
    f050673_f2.fits
    f050673_f3.fits
             .
             .
    f050673_f8.fits
 

 
 2.2 Starting NCDRT.

 Once the  data has been transformed  into fits files,  NCDRT can read
 them.  Start a new session of IDL and type

  idl> @ncdrt.com  

 to compile the programme files. 

 Then type  

  idl> ncdrt  

 to start NCDRT.


 
 2.3 Description of the text windows, buttons and consequent actions.

 The NCDRT  main interaction widget has several buttons, sliders and
 information windows, which are now described.

 2.3.1 Left column of the main widget.

 Description of  the left column of  the widget and  going through the
 rows from top to bottom:


 Load Data File:  load_obs.pro  with  switch  'next_obs' = 0
   A pick file dialog widget pops  up. The files listed by this widget
   are the f*_f1.fits files present in the directory. Select a file to
   load the data into NCDRT.

   The eight channels are loaded and stored. Seven average channels are
   being calculated and stored as channels 9-15.  Default is:

     channel  9 = (channel 1 + channel 3) / 2
     channel 10 = (channel 2 + channel 4) / 2
     channel 11 = (channel 5 + channel 7) / 2
     channel 12 = (channel 6 + channel 8) / 2
     channel 13 = (channel 1 to channel 4) / 4
     channel 14 = (channel 5 to channel 8) / 4
     channel 15 = (channel 1 to channel 8) / 8

   This can  of course  be changed  by the user.   In this  case, also
   change the naming of the channels stored in parameter channel_print
   and  defined  in  ncdrt_display.pro.  Average  channel  calibration
   needs also to be redefined in the routine write_2_cal_table.pro, as
   well as  the automatic (de-)selection of averaging  channels if the
   Averaging Switch (see description of this switch) is pressed for to
   change  from normal to  average mode  in the  current observation's
   process  (ncdrt_display_event.pro).  The  sky_load_obs.pro  routine
   also needs to be adapted.
   
   Search for the  USER: AVERAGING   keyword in these programme files.

   Whenever a fits  file is loaded, the fits file  list of the current
   directory is  determined and stored in  NCDRT. This is  used in the
   Load Next Data File and  Load Previous Data File actions (see below
   for description).

   Information  on the  current data  is read  from the  pou  file and
   displayed in the first text window.  This is why it is mandatory to
   have these files in the same directory as the fits files.

   load_obs.pro  will also  search for  the presence  of  result files
   produced previously. If it finds such  a file, it will read and set
   the  slider settings  from it.  The order  of priority  is .res_cal
   .res_av_cal .res .res_av (see  Save Result).  The routines involved
   are  read_res.pro and read_res_av.pro  In case  there is  no result
   file, NCDRT will define standard settings for the sliders.

   After  loading the  data and  setting  the sliders,  the result  is
   determined by  calling show_lin_cut.pro and  apply_lin_cut.pro (see
   section 5.1 on the working of these routines).

   The  results are  shown on  the  plots (scissors  and results)  and
   written to the large text window in the right column.

   The 'n_channel'  and 'ch_address'  are kept as  they are.   For the
   first file of a new session, they are set to

     n_channel = 8
     ch_address = 0
       
   This means that the first eight channels are being processed.


 Scissor Switch:  show_lin_cut.pro  with switch  'scissor'
  This function changes the scissor window between the normal mode and
  the detailed  mode. The normal mode  shows the entire  drift and the
  current  cutting settings. The  detailed mode  devides the  drift in
  three  parts, the  offset  (left  and right)  and  the central  part
  (peak).  This is useful  is the  contrast between  the peak  and the
  offset is large.


 Load Next Data File:  load_obs.pro  with  switch  'next_obs' = 1
   Loads the next  data file in the current  directory.  In case there
   are  no more  files,  the  pick file  dialog  widget appears.   The
   settings of the sliders are not changed.
    

 Load Previous Data File:  load_obs.pro  with  switch  'next_obs' = -1
   Loads the previous data file in the current directory. If there are
   no  previous  files, the  pick  file  dialog  widget appears.   The
   settings of the sliders are not changed.
 

 Averaging  Switch: ncdrt_display_event.pro  switches  'n_channel' and
                   'ch_address'   
   The  'n_channel' and  'ch_address'  switches are  changed to  their
   other values. The possible values for these switches are

      (n_channel,ch_address)  = (8,0)  or  (7,8)
       
    The  first set  means  that  the first  eight  channels are  being
    processed,  the  second  set  is  for the  last  seven  (averaging
    channels).

    Upon changing  from normal to averaging the  channel select string
    information  of  the normal  setting  is  kept.   Also an  average
    channel is automatically deselected  if one of the normal channels
    that are included in this average channel are deselected.


 Observation information window:
   Shows  information (name,  time, etc.)  of the  current observation
   loaded into NCDRT.


 Process information window:
   Shows  information (warnings etc.) of the current process.


 NCDRT Calibration Tool: calibration_display.pro  and associated routines
   Invokes the calibration tool. See section 3 for a detailed description.


 Create .ps  Of Result (Standard): write_result_2_ps.pro 
   This creates a standard postscript file of the current result, like
   in Save  Result (see above). The  postscript file is  named like in
   Save Result, with the extention .ps to it.

   Only  those channels are  selected which  have a  1 in  the channel
   select string.   In this way, you  can for example  output just the
   result of 1 channel at wish.

   The slider  settings are indicated  in the plot by  dotted (offset)
   and dashed (peak) lines.

   Other information  is also written in  the plot. From  the pou file
   come the indications  of the frequency and the  name of the object.
   The indication (cal) (or (not cal)) after the 'peak flux' string in
   the plot indicate that the data were calibrated (or not calibrated)
   with a calibration table.
  
 
 Create .ps  Of Result (Choose Name): write_result_2_ps.pro 
   Same as  previous button, but  now you can  choose the name  of the
   result file.


 2.3.2 Right column of the main widget.

 Description of the  right column of the widget  and going through the
 rows from top to bottom:


 Apply Calibration (Short Cut):  apply_calibration.pro
   Using this button the  calibration of the current calibration table
   is applied to the data without having to go to the Calibration Tool
   Widget.   It  is  the  same  as Apply  Calibration  button  of  the
   Calibration  Tool.    The  function  will  only  be   active  if  a
   calibration  table  is present.   This  and  all other  calibration
   functions have to be performed with the Calibration Tool.


 Comment Text  Window: 
   This window is  an editable window.  It allows the  user to write a
   maximum of 40 characters long comment line. The line is included in
   the result file when the  'Save Result' buttom is pressed, preceded
   by the word ' Comment : '.  By using the grep and awk function in a
   UNIX operating system  on all the existing result  files a log file
   of all the comments can easily be made.

  
 Save Result: save_res.pro
   Save the current result to a  standard file. There are four types of
   result files, depending on the status of the process:
           
     f050673.res, first 8 channels with no calibration applied
     f050673.res_av, averaging channels with no calibration applied
     f050673.res_cal, first 8 channels with calibration applied
     f050673.res_av, averaging channels with calibration applied

   Do never  change the  structure of these  files. NCDRT will  not be
   able to read them afterwards.


 Sliders: ncdrt_display_event.pro  and  show_lin_cut.pro
   There are four sliders: 

     Offset Low
     Offset High
     Peak Low
     Peak High

   The offset  sliders determine the part  of the data to  be used for
   the determination  of the offset.   There is a  build-in protection
   that prevents  these sliders from having  inappropriate values: the
   peak sliders must be at least  4 time units apart for the curve_fit
   procedure  in the apply_lin_cut.pro  routine to  work, and  the low
   offset slider  cannot be larger  than the high offset  slider.  low
   sliders cannot be set to more than half the range, Also, the offset
   sliders cannot  be set to 0 or  to the maximum of  points.  This is
   checked in  show_lin_cut.pro .  See section 5.1  for further detail
   on the working of show_lin_cut.pro and apply_lin_cut.pro .

   The result of the cutting can  be seen in the Scissors plot window.
   They change dynamically as the  slider values are changed. See also
   the explanation of the 'Scissor Switch', in section 2.3.1 .


 Information Text Window:
   This window shows the result of the current fit to the data. It are
   the values  which will be written to  a file if you  press the Save
   Result button. See  section 5.1 for more details  on the meaning of
   the numbers.


 Channel Select String: 
   The last text window in the right hand column contains the editable
   channel select  string. A  '1' means that  the selected  channel is
   processed  and  written to  the  result  file,  if this  action  is
   required.  A '0' means that the channels is ignored. In the case of
   processing  the  fours  averaging  channels, only  the  first  four
   switches of the channels select string are taken into account.  The
   use of the Averaging Switch resets the channel select string to all
   default values (all '1').
                       

 Quit: ncdrt_display_event.pro
       Quit NCDRT and kill all the windows.



 2.4 The planet.longitude file.

 NCDRT will search for a  file named planet.longitude in the directory
 /home/your_name/idlproc/NCDRT/planet/ . This  file contains a list of
 the scan  numbers (preceded by the  letter 'f', and  without the user
 id),  and the  Central  Meridian Longitude,  Sub  Earth Latitude  and
 Distance to the Earth (AU) of  the planet that the user has observed.
 The user must  create this file. It is  read in the ncdrt_display.pro
 routine (near the end). The  user can change the filename, place, and
 formatting at  wish. The  format of the  file must correspond  to the
 format of the reading.

 If  an observation  of the  planet is  reduced and  a result  file is
 saved, and if that file  is listed in the planet.longitude file, then
 an information  line is  written just below  the comment line  in the
 result file.  If the file is  not found, or if the observation is not
 in the list, then nothing is written (see the routine save_res.pro ).

 This feature  can be helpful  if a study  of the radio emission  of a
 planet as a function of Central Meridian Longitude and time is made.

 An example  file is included  in this distribution,  corresponding to
 the Mars file in the /home/your_name/idlproc/NCDRT/demo/ directory.



 3. Working with the Calibration Tool

 The calibration tool allows  to create and change calibration tables,
 as well as  apply or de-apply calibration parameters  to data.  NCDRT
 must be  in the eight  channel mode (no  averaging) for this  tool to
 work properly. 


 3.1 Description of the text windows, buttons and consequent actions.


 Create New Calibration Table: calibration_display_event.pro
   Create a  new calibration table and  write it to  the file selected
   with the pick file dialog widget. Any file name can be given.


 Read Existing Calibration Table: read_cal_table.pro
   Read  an existing calibration  table. The  pick file  dialog widget
   allows to chose the file. NCDRT checks if the file is a calibration
   table or not.


 Calibration table information text window:
   This  window contains  the information  about the  currently loaded
   calibration table.


 Write To Calibration Table: write_2_cal_table.pro
   This is  the routine  which does the  actual calibration.  The user
   must program  her/his calibrators and  frequencies. At the  time of
   writing,  three  calibrators  are  included, with  the  frequencies
   corresponding to  the maps  1 -  6 of the  P3B01 Mars  project. The
   routine uses the frequency read  by load_obs.pro in the pou file to
   identify the frequency set to use (parameter central_freq). It then
   checks  the name  of the  object (parameter  object), also  read by
   load_obs.pro  from   the  pou   file.  If  it   does  not   find  a
   correspondance   between   the  object   name   and  the   included
   calibrators, it will notify that no calibrator was found.

   The  absolute fluxes  for  the three  calibrators included  (3C123,
   3C161  and 3C295)  are taken  from Ott  et al.  (A&A  284, 331-339,
   1994, Table 5).

   Once the absolute fluxes  are calculated, the routine compares them
   to  the  measured  fluxes  from the  calibrator  observation.   The
   calibration factor  for each  channel is determined  (including the
   error, which  is the  total error, see  section 5.1), also  for the
   averaging  channels.  It  is  assumed that  the  calibrator is  non
   polarised,  so that every  channels corresponds  to half  the total
   flux (in fact, the total flux  is what is written in these channels
   by NAPS).


   The results of this exercise  are written to the calibration table.
   They  are  also  plotted   in  the  calibration  plot  window  (see
   calibration plot window for explanation).

   Here  the channel select  string is  taken into  account !  You can
   select the good and bad channels for your calibrator.


 Delete From Calibration Table: delete_from_cal_table.pro
   Delete  the current calibrator  from the  calibration table,  if it
   exists in the table.


 Create .ps Of Calibration Table: calibration_display_event.pro
   Create a postscript  file of the calibration table  data.  The file
   name  of  the  postscript  file  will  be  the  file  name  of  the
   calibration table followed by .ps .


 Calibration process information:
   This window contains information  (warnings etc.) about the current
   process.


 Apply Current Calibration: apply_calibration.pro   
   Apply the  calibration factors of the current  calibration table to
   the  current  data.  Each  channel  is  multiplied  by the  set  of
   calibration factors (8+4 channels)  from the calibration table that
   is  closest  in time  to  the  current  observation.  This  can  be
   different  for different channels,  as not  all channels  will have
   good  calibration data  for each  observation !   In  this version,
   nothing is done with the calibration factor error.


 De-apply Current Calibration: calibration_display_event.pro
   De-apply any calibration of the  current data. In fact, the current
   data is restored to  its initial values (copy from channel_data_ori
   to the channel_data parameter).


 Dismiss: calibration_display_event.pro
   Dismiss the calibration tool, and  kill the plot window if any.  If
   any calibration  table was loaded,  this table will stay  loaded in
   NCDRT.



 3.2 Explanation on the calibration plot window.

 In this window  the calibration factors for each  channel as from the
 current calibration  table are plotted  and updated if any  action is
 taken (new calibration data  or deleting of calibration data).  There
 are 8 sets of 2 frames.  These correspond to the eight channels.  The
 top  frame of each  set shows  the entire  calibration data  for that
 channel, the lower frame shows a  detail of that data only around the
 time of the current observation. A dotted vertical line indicates the
 position of the current observation time.  If this time is out of the
 calibrator table range, the whole  set is also plotted in the smaller
 frame.

 In the  first seven sets, the  dashed line correspond  to the average
 channels (9-15).

 A cross  means that the channel  was not selected  for the particular
 time.

 If a  new data file is  loaded, while the calibration  tool is active
 with calibration  table loaded, then  the calibration plot  window is
 updated to show the time of the current observation.



 4. Working with the Sky Subtration Tool

 The  Sky Subtraction Tool  allows to  subtract two  observations from
 each other.   This is of particular  use when the  data concern solar
 system objects,  in which the same  spot of the sky  is observed with
 and without the object.

 If  calibration is  applied to  the data,  then the  same calibration
 table is used to simultaneously calibrate the sky data. Note that the
 calibration   factors  can   differ  between   the  object   and  sky
 observations,  as  both  observations  could have  been  made  during
 different epochs.

 The process  of subtraction takes places AFTER  the individual offset
 corrections to both the object and the sky observations.

 IMPORTANT: if  you want to save  the results of the  subtraction to a
 .res file  using the  'save' button in  the main widget  (see section
 2.3.2), then the Sky Subtraction Tool must be open !


 4.1 Description of the text windows, buttons and consequent actions.

 Load Sky Data File: sky_load_obs.pro
   Load a  file that contains the  sky observation. The  format of the
   file and the  loading process are entirly similar  to the Load Data
   File in the main widget. This includes the averaging. The result is
   shown in a plot with the same structure as the Results plot.


 Observation information window:
   Shows  information (name,  time, etc.)  of the  current observation
   loaded into NCDRT.


 Process information window:
   Shows  information (warnings etc.) of the current process.


 Main Slider Tracking Switch: sky_subtract_event.pro  switch  
                              'main_slider_track'
   By default, the  offset cutting sliders of the  sky observation are
   set  to the  same values  as the  object observation.  If  the main
   sliders  are changed, the  sky sliders  will also  change. Pressing
   this   button   will   give   independent  control   of   the   sky
   sliders.  Pressing it  again will  undo  this control  and set  the
   sliders back to the main slider values.
 

 Sky Offset Low: sky_subtract_event.pro
   The cutting value for the low offset. The value is shown in the top
   left frame of  the plot (with a dotted line).  The default value is
   the offset value from the main widget.


 Sky Offset High: sky_subtract_event.pro
   The cutting  value for the high  offset. The value is  shown in the
   top left frame of the plot  (with a dotted line). The default value
   is the offset value from the main widget.


 Sky Shift: sky_apply_lin_cut.pro
   The time shift  in the sky observation before  subtracting from the
   object. The extremes  are set to -25 and +25, and  can of course be
   changed  (in sky_subtract_display.pro).  The shifting  takes places
   after  the offset correction  has been  performed. The  time points
   left blank are set to zero.


 Do Sky Subtraction: sky_subtract_event.pro  switch  sky_subtract_apply
   Apply the sky subtraction to the data.


 Undo Sky Subtraction: sky_subtract_event.pro  switch  sky_subtract_apply
   Undo the sky subtraction.


 Dismiss:
   Dismiss the Sky Subtraction Tool.



 5. The working of NCDRT, some details.

 The source files are all human readable files. All the programmes are
 .pro files. The .CB files  are the Common Blocks.  The ncdrt_v1.0.pro
 file contains the  first version of NCDRT, which  is quite primitive.
 NCDRT uses the READFITS.PRO routine from the IDL astro routines.  The
 complete set of these routines can be found on URL:

         idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html

 The routine is included in this distribution of NCDRT.


 5.1 Working of routines  SHOW_LIN_CUT and APPLY_LIN_CUT .

 A NRT drift scan is a measure  of the flux as a function of time. The
 first three seconds  of the scan are used  to observe the calibration
 noise tube.  NCDRT ignores these  first three items.  The rest of the
 scan sees the  system noise and the source, as  it drifts through the
 field of view  of the system. In order to  measure the source's flux,
 the  system noise needs  to be  subtracted. It  is assumed  that this
 noise, the offset, is a line as a function of time.

 The offset sliders (see section 2.3) determine which part of the scan
 is  used for  the  offset line  determination.  This is  from t=1  to
 t=offset_low plus t=offset_high to  t=end_scan. The offset limits are
 defined  and  the  same  for  all  the channels.  The  line  is  then
 subtracted from the whole scan.  Now the peak value of the object can
 be measured.

 The offset sliders determine the part  of the data to be used for the
 determination  of the offset.   There is  a build-in  protection that
 prevents  these sliders  from having  inappropriate values:  the peak
 sliders  must  be at  least  4 time  units  apart  for the  curve_fit
 procedure  in the  apply_lin_cut.pro  routine to  work,  and the  low
 offset  slider cannot  be larger  than the  high offset  slider.  low
 sliders cannot be  set to more than half the  range, Also, the offset
 sliders cannot  be set  to 0 or  to the  maximum of points.   This is
 checked  in  the   show_lin_cut.pro  routine.   The  show_lin_cut.pro
 routine then plots the first channel (by default, this can be changed
 by  the  user), corrected  by  the offset,  in  a  small plot  window
 (scissors) and shows the offset lines.

 The peak  sliders determine which part of  the scan is to  be used to
 fit the peak of the object. This is also plotted in the scissors-plot
 by show_lin_cut.pro .

 The  routine  apply_lin_cut.pro  fits  a  gaussian  function  to  the
 selected  peak.   It  uses  the  IDL routine  GAUSSFIT  with  initial
 estimates of the four parameters a(0), a(1), a(2) and a(3).

   f(x) = a(0) * EXP(-z^2 / 2) + a(3)
   with   z = (x-a(1)) / a(2)

 The results  are shown in  the result plot  window and in  the result
 text box in  the right hand colomn of the NCDRT  widget.  The flux at
 the peak is a(0) + a(3).

 Three estimates of the noise level are calculated and reported:

   (1) standard deviation  of the (peak  - gaussian fit) for  the peak
       selection of the scan only;

   (2) standard deviation  of the (scan - offset_line)  for the offset
       selection of the scan only;

   (3) standard deviation of the combination of (1) and (2).



 6. Demonstration data from project Mars P3B01.

 The  directory /home/your_name/idlproc/NCDRT/demo/ contains  a couple
 of observations of  Mars and of the calibrator  source 3C123 taken at
 the end of August 2003.  You  can test the funcionalities of NCDRT on
 these   data.    Just   untar   the  NCDRT_demo.tar   file   to   the
 /home/your_name/idlproc/NCDRT  directory (or  any other  directory of
 your  choice).  The  observations  050466  and 060341  are  the  same
 observations  as 050403  and  053737 respectively  but without  Mars.
 These are included to demonstrate  the working of the Sky Subtraction
 Tool.  The pair (053737,060341) include a time shift.


 7. Responsibility and use of NCDRT.

 I am not responsible of the correct or incorrect working of NCDRT.  I
 have tested the tool  and I use it to reduce and  analyse my own data
 (project P3B01): it seems to work fine.  I am not responsible for any
 problems with your  data that may occur from  using NCDRT.  Always be
 careful  with your  data, and  make a  backup copy  before  you start
 reducing and analysing.
 
 Please   feel   free   to   ask   any   questions   about   or   give
 comments/suggestions  on NCDRT.   Please also  feel free  to  use the
 source files  and adapt  them to your  personal needs,  expanding the
 tool with many other utilities. Keep me informed !
